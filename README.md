### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Ashish Kumar Mishra. I am an earnest techie with keen interest in every new updates that come up everyday. I love being hardworking and dedicated to whatever I take up as a task. Web development attracts me the most. And I also have some basic idea in android. Apart from that I also have knowledge on SEO.The last one year has been an amazing experience. The journey of my BTech years has started with these new experiences and I felt a keen interest growing in me. Getting to learn these things have always been worth it. But this is just the beginning. I am always brushing up my skills more to attain perfection. Looking forward to gather more knowledge and being more accurate in my field.
